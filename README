    Wristband is an Android application that uses your GPS location to find local shows,
    compile a playlist of local music, and give you a map to the venue.
    Wristband uses the SongKick and Bandcamp APIs to accomplish this but is not 
    associated with or endorsed by any of these companies.
    The aim of wristband is to connect fans of local music and bands that they would 
    otherwise have never heard of.  You might find something you like.
